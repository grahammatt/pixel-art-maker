# Pixel Art Maker
A single-page pixel art web app made during my participation in the [Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google).

## About
This project is a responsive web app that dynamically creates a paintable grid via JavaScript. The active color can be changed using the color picker dropdown or the eyedropper tool to sample previously used colors on the grid. The eraser tool will revert grid cells back to white.
